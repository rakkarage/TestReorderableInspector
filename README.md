# TestReorderableInspector

Ever drag multiple items to an inspector field and they end up in the wrong order?

Unity has an internal reorderable list control that accepts files in correct order and allows reorder... but not as easy to use as other controls.

This package 'automatically' replaces 'all' lists with reorderable lists.
