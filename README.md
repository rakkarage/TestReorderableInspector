# TestReorderableInspector

ever drag multiple items to an inspector field and they end up in the wrong order?

<https://github.com/SubjectNerd-Unity/ReorderableInspector>

this can now automatically replace all lists and arrays with a reorderable version

works for randomTile (TileBase)
does not work for randomBrush (GridBrush)

says in docs need to use [Reorderable] to force it to work but that does not seem to work either?

- test my own tileOrientation drawer
- must be unity bug

please help
thanks
